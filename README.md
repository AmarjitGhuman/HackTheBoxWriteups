# HackTheBox Writeups

Since Spring 2020, I have just scrapped in the top 1000 hackers on HTB. I have been trying to give back to the community by drafting writeup reports for the machine I've completed on Hack the Box, which is a website for practising ethical hacking.

## Beginner-Friendly All The Way
I pitch every report for a 'beginner', regardless of the difficulty of the machine. I've made this choice as I consider writeups to be a great learning resource for people trying to get started in the area. I am always available for for a chat when it comes to cyber, and especially ethical hacking for beginners. 

If you're a beginner looking for tips on how to take effective notes, please see my file on 'HTB Notetaking Tips'

## Active Machines
Active machines are downloadable PDFs, locked with passwords. Retired machines are free to pursue in their own folder above. 
With each active box, I state the required password below you will need to unlock it, so please keep an eye out for this. 

### Monteverde
Password protected with Administrator's password that you recieve at the end of the box
