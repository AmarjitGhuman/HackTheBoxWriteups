# HackTheBox Writeups

Since Spring 2020, I have just scrapped in the top 1000 hackers on HTB. I have been trying to give back to the community by drafting writeup reports for the machine I've completed on Hack the Box, which is a website for practising ethical hacking.

## Beginner-Friendly All The Way
I pitch every report for a 'beginner', regardless of the difficulty of the machine. I've made this choice as I consider writeups to be a great learning resource for people trying to get started in the area. I am always available for for a chat when it comes to cyber, and especially ethical hacking for beginners. 

If you're a beginner looking for tips on how to take effective notes, please see my file on 'HTB Notetaking Tips'

## Retired Machines
Retired machines are free to peruse in their own folder above, with no password. Download the PDF, as it renders slowly and weirdly on the Github viewer. 

## Active Machines
Active machines are downloadable PDFs, locked with passwords. Click on the PDF you wamt and download it to your computer. 
With each active box, I state the required password you will need to unlock it when prompted after you open it on your computer, so please keep an eye out for this. 

### Blunder
Password is the root process we use to priv esc =  /xyz/wxyz

### Cache
Password is root hash, starts with bW ends with kb/

### Cascade
Password protected with the decoded Administrator's password

### Magic
Password is the command used to gain root, beginning with 's'

### Sauna
Password is the NTLM hash gained at the end of the box, begining with 'd' ends with 'f'
